a) What did I work on last time?
       - Check the process of the whole system
       - ls, exit, output, error all finished
       - Demo created for demo running, testing cases added
       - e-3, e-4, f-1 from SB2

b) What do I plan to work on now?
       - create a better demo, debug more so more features can be added
       - Writing Test situations for ls, exit, output, error
       - f-2 from SB3

c) Am I blocked on anything?
       - Error and Man System should be created and mantained in a proper way
