a) What did I work on last time?
       - Discuss with teammates for what to do in Sprint6
       - Start improve previous LS method for some left methods :(.././multiple paths)
       - write test cases for previous classes
       - a-2, a-3, h-1 from SB6

b) What do I plan to work on now?
       - Write Testing Cases / Do research for unit testing
       - Solve the problem that .. may appears in middle of multiple paths
       - h-2 from SB6

c) Am I blocked on anything?
       - in LS command, the relative path ".." / "." may appears anywhere, needa pointer to trace the current working directory and also print all of those result in order
       - what should we implement the format of the recursive call?
