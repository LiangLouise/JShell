a) What did I work on last time?
       - Check the process of the whole system
       - Implement Recursive cases for LS command
       - Reconstructure helper method from public to private
       - read the requirments carefully and set Sprint and add user stories to backlog
       - Write Testing Cases / Do research for unit testing
       - Update isValid methods so ls can be used in more situations
       - a-1, a-3 from SB5

b) What do I plan to work on now?
       - Discuss with teammates for what to do in Sprint6
       - SB6

c) Am I blocked on anything?
       - LS has unexpected error, could be problems happened from other public method but be catched by our exception catcher which makes the debug very difficult
