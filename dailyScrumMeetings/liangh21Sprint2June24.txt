a) What did I work on last time?
       - Debugging for exit and Output finished
       - Output is created alone with an Error system
       - chosen to use Enum class to set Error System
       - e-3, f-1 from SB2

b) What do I plan to work on now?
       - Debugging and testing other partners' works
       - Check the process of the whole system
       - Discussion about the future process and tasks
       - f-1 from SB2

c) Am I blocked on anything?
       - Can Enum be accessed by other classes with importing?
