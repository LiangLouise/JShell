What did I do last time?
    -- Worked on the JShellDriver to get start
    -- Optimized the designs of the Jshell and update the CRC cards with the team members.

What do I plan to do now?
    -- To make sure how the work will be distributed in the Sprint 2 and finish the part I am supposed to do.
    -- Negotiate with the team members about the some design problems such as the Jshell's function.

Am I blocked on anything?
