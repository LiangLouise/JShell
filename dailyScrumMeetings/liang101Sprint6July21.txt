What did I do last time?
    -- Create CRC cards for !Number
    -- Implement Number class to code
    -- add some test cases for Number class and previous commands written by me
    -- Change the way to create command by using reflection
    -- Has begun to write build.xml

What do I plan to do now?
	-- Check if there is any bug still existing
	-- think about how to finish the build.xml with unitTest

Am I blocked on anything?
    - N/A
