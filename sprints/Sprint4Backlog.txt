User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:

{Finalization Period, Testing and debuting for all classes and user stories}
	a) As a JShell user, I want to exit and close the program. ( exit ) -- 3
	b) As a JShell user, I want to create directory in my current-working-directory (or any address I want to create). ( mkdir DIR ) -- 3
	c) As a JShell user, I want to check all the files and directories in current-working-directory (or any directory I want to check). ( ls ) -- 3
	d) As a JShell user, I want to change my current-working-directory to any address I want. ( cd DIR ) -- 3
	e) As a JShell user, I want to get the address of current-working-directory. ( pwd ) -- 3
	f) As a JShell user, I want to see the content of a file or several other files. ( cat FILE1 [FILE2] ) -- 6
	g) As a JShell user, I want to see the content of a file and also be able to write the content in other files. ( echo FILE1 [> FILE2] ) -- 9
	h) As a JShell user, I want to see the user manual with the usage of all functions for this JShell program. ( man CMD ) -- 9
	i)As a JShell user, I want to find Directory and file with name input at the specific Directory. (find) -- 7
	j)As a JShell user, I want to see how all the directories and files are related to the root with a tree-like format. (tree) --3
